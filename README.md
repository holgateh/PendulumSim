# PendulumSim
This project is physics simulation created for my Computer Science A-Level project which implements the following:
- A spring-mass system.
- A string-mass system.
- A double string-mass system.

Note: each of the above has a graphical display of the simulation variable which are angular displacement, angular velocity, angular acceleration and energy (both potential and kinetic). Also, controls are available to change simulation parameters like bob length, mass, spring constant (for the spring-mass system). 

The Visual Studio project is included in the source.

Images of the application can be seen below.
