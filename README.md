# PendulumSim
This project is physics simulation created for my Computer Science A-Level project which implements the following:
- A spring-mass system.
- A string-mass system.
- A double string-mass system.

Note: each of the above has a graphical display of the simulation variable which are angular displacement, angular velocity, angular acceleration and energy (both potential and kinetic).

The Visual Studio project is included in the source.
